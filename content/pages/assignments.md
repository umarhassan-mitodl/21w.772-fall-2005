A: Start Wiki poem General questions you should consider:  
  
1) What generative devices do you associate with poetry? That is, what mechanics of writing do you recognize as means to get a poem going?  
2) What mechanics of games do you think are applicable to poetry? What other aspects of games?  
  
3) What, if any, relationships exist between the traditions of "found poetry" and the kind of digital poems you have been creating?  
  
4) What elements of the oral poetry traditions we briefly alluded to in class last week could be extended to forms of digital poetry? What about location-based poems? Performance poetry?  
  
5) What other kinds of "interaction" beyond those you used in your hypertext poems might be used in creating digital poems?
